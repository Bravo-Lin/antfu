<h1>Bravo Lin</h1>

<vivid-typing spilt-tag="span" content="Hi I'm bravo lin, a front-end developer and currently based in <%><span class='i-mi:location'></span></%>Xiamen." />

This is my personal [blog](/posts) for writing some thoughts on life and technology.I also have a [yueque repository](https://www.yuque.com/bravolin) for documenting learning, check it out if you're interested.<span class="i-mi:apple"/>

Outside of programming I'm also quite interested in music, philosophy and games, but in most of these areas I'm more of an appreciator than a creator, hahaha.

I'm still learning how to be a creator (in any field) because it's really cool. If you have any interesting ideas let me know, maybe we can try it out.
